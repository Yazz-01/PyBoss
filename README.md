I use Python Disctionary to help a company to fix its employee records to the new required format from HR.

In summary, the required conversions are as follows:


The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.


The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.


The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.


The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.




Special Hint: You may find this link to be helpfulâ€”Python Dictionary for State Abbreviations.
